                <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed
                  into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could
                  see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly
                  able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with
                  the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought.
                  It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between
                  its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a
                  travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated
                  magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa
                  who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.
                  Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops</p>
                <p><i>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there
                  live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a
                  large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the
                  necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your

                <p>The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question
                  Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia,
                  put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the
                  Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline
                  of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran
                  over her cheek,</p>
